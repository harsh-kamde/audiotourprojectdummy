Here's an updated pseudo pathway based on your requirements:

1. Map Integration with Google Maps:
   a. Add the `google_maps_flutter` package as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.
   b. Obtain the necessary API key from the Google Cloud Platform Console for using Google Maps services.
   c. Set up the necessary configurations for the Google Maps plugin in your Flutter app.
   d. Create a screen that displays the map using the `GoogleMap` widget from the `google_maps_flutter` package.
   e. Customize the map view, add markers for the driver's position and bus position, and implement the necessary interactions.

2. Location Sharing with Geolocator:
   a. Add the `geolocator` package as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.
   b. Use the package's APIs to fetch the driver's live location based on the device's GPS capabilities.
   c. Configure the location service to provide periodic location updates.
   d. Set up Firebase Firestore to store the driver's location data.
   e. Update the stored location data in Firestore at regular intervals to reflect the driver's live location.

3. Alert System:
   a. Calculate Distance:
      - Use the Haversine formula or the `geolocator` package to calculate the distance between the passenger's location and the bus's current position.

   b. Trigger Alerts:
      - When the calculated distance is within 2 kilometers, send a push notification using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

4. User Interface:
   a. Design the screens for the driver and passenger interfaces.
   b. Implement a map view using the `GoogleMap` widget from `google_maps_flutter` to display the driver's and bus's positions.
   c. Implement additional UI elements such as distance information, ETA, and any desired features like a chat or messaging interface.

5. Firebase Integration:
   a. Set up Firebase in your Flutter project by following the Firebase Flutter setup guide.
   b. Use Firebase Firestore to store the driver's location data.
   c. Use Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications to passengers when the bus is within 2 kilometers.
