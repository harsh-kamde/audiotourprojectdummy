Concept of Flutter app that has two modes: one for drivers to share their live location and another for passengers to view the current position of the bus and receive an alert when the bus is within 2 kilometers. Let's break down the concept into different components and discuss them in detail.

1. User Roles:
   a. Drivers: They will use the app to share their live location.
   b. Passengers: They will use the app to view the current position of the bus and receive alerts.

2. Location Sharing:
   a. Drivers: The app will allow drivers to share their live location using the device's GPS capabilities. This location will be updated periodically.
   b. Passengers: The app will display the current position of the bus based on the location shared by the driver. It will continuously update the position as the driver moves.

3. Alert System:
   a. Proximity Detection: The app will calculate the distance between the passenger's location and the bus's current position using GPS coordinates.
   b. Alert Trigger: When the bus comes within 2 kilometers of the passenger's location, an alert will be triggered.
   c. Notification: The passenger will receive a notification on their device informing them that the bus is nearing their location.

4. Communication:
   a. Driver-Passenger Communication: The app can provide a communication channel between the driver and passengers, such as a chat feature or messaging system.
   b. Driver-Admin Communication: The app may also include a communication channel between the driver and the app administrator for any urgent or important notifications.

5. User Interface:
   a. Driver Interface: The driver's interface will include a map view with their live location and possibly additional information such as the route, speed, and distance covered.
   b. Passenger Interface: The passenger's interface will display a map with the current position of the bus, the passenger's location, and relevant information like estimated time of arrival (ETA).

6. Backend and Database:
   a. Location Storage: The app's backend will store the location data of the driver and update it regularly.
   b. User Authentication: The app will require user authentication to ensure only authorized drivers and passengers can access the respective features.
   c. Database Management: The backend will manage the user data, such as driver profiles and passenger preferences.

7. Security and Privacy:
   a. Data Encryption: Location data and user information should be encrypted to ensure secure transmission and storage.
   b. Privacy Considerations: The app should adhere to privacy regulations and inform users about data collection, storage, and usage.

8. Additional Features:
   a. Booking and Scheduling: The app could include features to allow passengers to book seats or schedule trips in advance.
   b. Route Tracking: The app could display the route taken by the driver and provide real-time updates on any deviations or delays.
